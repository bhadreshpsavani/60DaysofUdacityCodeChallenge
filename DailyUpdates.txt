Working on ASL Sign Language gesture recognition project with @Munira Omar  @Shubhendu Mishra @Ruchika Khemka @Anju Mercian and @Aarthi Alagammai
Came to know that dynamic background substraction technique i used will not work in our case because it removes all the static things and hand will not always be in the movement so i am going to use first frame as a reference frame and remove it from all the other frames of video
I have read these amazing medium article https://medium.com/@soffritti.pierfrancesco/handy-hands-detection-with-opencv-ac6e9fb3cec1
Going throw the code of one hand extracting software which is written in c++ 
https://github.com/PierfrancescoSoffritti/Handy
I will try to implement it using python and optimise it according to our requirement

13th August 2019:Day48
Working on ASL Sign Language gesture recognition project
Today i have worked on skin colour detection part of the hand extraction tool,
I Will use one rectangle to detect hand sample from video
I will use this sample to threshold image so that only colour range related to only hand will be visible
