1. Today I had online meet up with @abhimanyutiwari3412 and @0107wy. Happy to connect with you.
2. Join study group with @abhimanyutiwari3412@mukulkathpalia , @0107wy and many other.
3. Continued with lesson 7 project

1th July 2019: Day5
-I have continued with lesson 7 final project code

2th July 2019: Day6
Completed Lesson 7 on Federated Learning
Worked on Project on Federated Learning
Here are the steps I followed,
1. Created dummy dataset and labels,
2. Created few virtual workers,
3. Distributed dataset in different workers and trained each models on each workers
4. Get the all model on secure worker and avg the gradient

3th July 2019: Day7
Started Lesson 8
Completed 3 videos and write code for first small project

4th July 2019: Day8
- Completed lesson 8
- working on final project of lesson 8

5th July 2019: Day9

- continued working on final project of lesson 8
- continued working on slack bot

7th July 2019: Day11
1) Read articles about federated learning
2) Revised concepts of federated learning
3) Working on differential privacy final project with different approach by increasesing number of teachers in it.

8th July 2019: Day12
1. Participated in ama_session
2. Participated in boom for basics in #beginners
3. Was a part of virtual meetup with @Khush @Oudarjya Sen Sarma @Sourav @Soumya Nasipuri @Shivam Raisharma @Aisha Khatun

9th July 2019: Day13
completed final project of lesson5
I have implemented differential privacy on MNIST dataset by dividing it in to *120* dataset and trained *119* model to make it as Teachers and predicted labels for *120th* dataset and at the and got following result,
Data Independent Epsilon: 51.51292546497024
Data Dependent Epsilon: 3.2143168878667040
Here is the my notebook, https://github.com/bhadreshpsavani/ColabNotebooks/blob/master/DiffrentialPrivacyProject.ipynb

10th July 2019: Day14
1. Worked on final project of Federated Learning and solved earlier problem i found to train model using virtual machine using GPU
2. Started working on Kaggle competitions of Blindness detection with  @Gogulaanand R @Shanmugapriya @Shahana @Ankit Dubey in

11th July 2019:Day15
Started Dataset analysis part of Blindness detection kaggle competition using pytorch.
dataset was of 10gb size, i tried importing it using *kaggle api* in colab but ended up all resources used error
Finally concluded that i can only work on this 10gb dataset on kaggle kernel only for free :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
